This code uses a module called Turtle to draw a flower shape. The Turtle module allows you to control a little turtle that moves around the screen.

First, it creates a turtle object named "pen" to draw with.

Then, it sets the speed of the turtle to 10, which means it will draw fairly quickly.

Next, it starts drawing the flower. It does this by repeating a set of instructions 36 times. Each time it goes through the loop, it makes the turtle move forward by 100 units, turn right by 45 degrees, move forward again by 100 units, turn right by 135 degrees, move forward once more by 100 units, turn right by 45 degrees, move forward one last time by 100 units, and finally turn right by 135 degrees. After that, it turns right by 10 degrees to start the next petal of the flower.

Finally, it hides the turtle so you can see the flower without the turtle getting in the way.

You can click on the drawing window to close it when you're done admiring the flower.
